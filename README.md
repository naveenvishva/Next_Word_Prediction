# Text Generation with LSTM

This project implements a text generation model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model is trained on the Sherlock Holmes stories dataset and can generate text based on the provided seed text.

## Introduction

Text generation is a fascinating application of natural language processing and deep learning. This project showcases the use of LSTM neural networks to generate coherent text based on patterns learned from a large corpus of text data.

## Features

- Trains an LSTM model on the Sherlock Holmes stories dataset.
- Generates text based on the provided seed text.
- Supports customization of model architecture and training parameters.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-generation-lstm.git
   cd text-generation-lstm
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the text generation model and save it:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Generating Text

To generate text using the trained model:

```bash
python generate_text.py
```
